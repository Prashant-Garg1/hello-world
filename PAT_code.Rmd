## Create PAT
Get a personal access token (PAT) and use that as your credential for HTTPS operations.

The usethis package has a helper function that takes you to the web form to create a PAT, with the added benefit that it pre-selects the recommended scopes:

Once on the page, click 'generate token' and then store the PAT somewhere 
(I have emailed it to myself.)

```{r}
install.packages('usethis')

library(usethis)

usethis::create_github_token()
```


## Store your credentials

First we need to install credentials.
Insert the PAT when requested.

```{r}
install.packages("credentials")

library(credentials)

set_github_pat()
```

Now, set the credentials with the following commands.

```{r}
install.packages("gitcreds")

library(gitcreds)

gitcreds_set()
```
